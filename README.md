# GSAP-On-Scroll-Walking-Cycle-using-HTML-CSS-and-Javascript
Creating a walking cycle animation on scroll using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) is an engaging and visually appealing way to bring life to a web page.

# Steps:
1. Create a file index.html
2. Create another file for styling i.e. style.css
3. Create a javascript file named as script.js
4. Run index.html in any web browser

This project involves several key components and concepts:

## HTML Structure: You'll begin by setting up the HTML structure for your web page. This typically includes the main container where the animation will take place and any additional elements you want to include on the page.

## CSS Styling: CSS is used to define the visual appearance of your walking character or object. You'll create styles for the character's body parts (e.g., legs, arms, torso) and any other design elements you want to incorporate. To make the animation more convincing, you may use CSS transitions and transformations to manipulate these elements.

## GSAP Setup: GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) is a powerful JavaScript library for creating animations. You'll need to include GSAP in your project, which can be done by linking to the GSAP library in your HTML file or installing it through a package manager like npm.

## JavaScript Logic: With GSAP, you'll set up JavaScript functions to control the animation. Specifically, you'll create functions that respond to the user's scroll position on the page. As the user scrolls, the JavaScript code will trigger the walking cycle animation.

## Scroll Trigger: GSAP's ScrollTrigger plugin is particularly useful for this type of animation. You'll use it to tie animation triggers to specific scroll positions. For example, when the user scrolls to a certain point on the page, the walking cycle will start, and as they scroll further, the character will appear to walk.

## Keyframe Animation: Within your JavaScript functions, you'll define keyframes for the walking cycle. This involves specifying the different positions and rotations of the character's body parts (e.g., moving legs forward and backward) at specific points in time. GSAP makes it easy to animate these transitions smoothly.

## Timing and Easing: You can control the timing and easing of the animation using GSAP's features. Adjusting the timing can make the animation appear more natural, while easing functions determine how the animation accelerates and decelerates.

## Event Listeners: Event listeners may be used to ensure the animation starts and stops at the right scroll positions. You may also add additional interactions or events to enhance user engagement.

## Testing and Debugging: It's crucial to test your animation in different browsers and devices to ensure it works smoothly and looks great. Debugging any issues that arise is an important part of the development process.

## Optimization: Finally, consider optimizing your code and assets to ensure a fast and responsive user experience. Compress images and minify your JavaScript and CSS files for improved performance.
